## Notes

This project is an exploration of React/Redux with the perspective of someone familiar with the Vue-Vuex model of state management. The subject matter of the project is a mood app that I made at General Assembly's Web Development Intensive in April 2017. Now that I am significantly more skilled in front-end frameworks, I'm experimenting with different ways of remaking the app. This is the React version.

## Development

```bash
npm install && npm start
```
